Weather Forecast App:

Create a weather forecast app that allows users to check the weather for a specific location. Users can enter the name of a city or a ZIP code, and the app will fetch the weather data from a weather API and display it to the user.

Features:

Allow users to enter the location (city or ZIP code) for which they want to check the weather.
Fetch weather data from a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap) based on the user's input.
Display the current weather conditions (temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, etc.) for the specified location.
Show a 5-day weather forecast with daily high and low temperatures, weather descriptions, and icons.
Provide a simple and user-friendly interface.
Technologies:

Node.js and Express.js for building the backend server.
Axios or Fetch API to make API requests to the weather API.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend to create the user interface.
Handlebars, EJS, or other templating engines for rendering dynamic data on the frontend.
Optional Enhancements:

Add geolocation support to automatically detect the user's location and display the weather for that location.
Implement error handling for invalid input and API request failures.
Allow users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units for temperature.
Add a background image that changes based on the weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy, etc.).
Include a search history or favorites section to store previously searched locations.
Remember to use environment variables for sensitive information, such as API keys, and handle errors gracefully to provide a smooth user experience. Good luck with your project!
